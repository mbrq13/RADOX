MEDICAL REPORT - CHEST X-RAY ANALYSIS
================================================================

PATIENT INFORMATION:
- Patient ID: ${patientId}
- Study Date: ${new Date(studyDate).toLocaleDateString("en-US", {
        year: "numeric",
        month: "long",
        day: "numeric",
      })}
- Analysis Date: ${currentDate}
- Analysis Time: ${currentTime}
- Study Type: Chest X-ray PA
- Analysis Method: AI MedGemma-4B

RADIOLOGICAL FINDINGS:
Automated AI analysis has identified patterns consistent with pneumonia.

AI DIAGNOSIS: ${diagnosis}
CONFIDENCE LEVEL: ${Math.round(confidence * 100)}%

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
- Pulmonary opacities suggestive of consolidation observed
- Infiltrate pattern compatible with infectious process
- Distribution typical of bacterial pneumonia
- No significant pleural effusion evident
- Cardiac silhouette within normal limits

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. URGENT MEDICAL EVALUATION required
2. Clinical correlation with patient symptoms
3. Consider complementary studies (CBC, CRP, cultures)
4. Initiate antibiotic therapy per medical protocol
5. Radiological follow-up in 48-72 hours

IMPORTANT NOTE:
This analysis has been performed using artificial intelligence and must be 
validated by a certified radiologist. Does not substitute professional medical judgment.

STUDY LIMITATIONS:
- Analysis based solely on radiographic image
- Requires correlation with clinical history
- System sensitivity: 89.2%
- System specificity: 92.7%

PATIENT INFORMATION:

- Study Date: ${new Date(studyDate).toLocaleDateString("en-US", {
        year: "numeric",
        month: "long",

      })}
- Analysis Date: ${currentDate}
- Analysis Time: ${currentTime}
- Study Type: Chest X-ray PA
- Analysis Method: AI MedGemma-4B

RADIOLOGICAL FINDINGS:
Automated analysis identifies subtle changes that could be compatible with early pneumonia.

AI DIAGNOSIS: ${diagnosis}
CONFIDENCE LEVEL: ${Math.round(confidence * 100)}%

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
- Subtle opacities in pulmonary fields
- Slightly increased interstitial pattern
- Possible infiltrates in early stage
- Cardiac silhouette within normal limits
- No obvious consolidation

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Medical evaluation for clinical correlation
2. Close monitoring of respiratory symptoms
3. Consider repeat X-ray in 24-48 hours if symptoms persist
4. Monitor for progression signs: fever, cough, dyspnea
5. Maintain general supportive measures

INTERPRETATION:
Findings suggest the possibility of early-stage pulmonary inflammatory process. 
Medical evaluation required to determine need for therapeutic intervention.

RECOMMENDED FOLLOW-UP:
- Clinical control in 24-48 hours
- New X-ray if clinical worsening
- Consider additional studies based on evolution

        year: "numeric",

- Analysis Date: ${currentDate}
- Analysis Time: ${currentTime}
- Study Type: Chest X-ray PA
- Analysis Method: AI MedGemma-4B

RADIOLOGICAL FINDINGS:
Automated analysis does not identify radiological signs suggestive of pneumonia.

AI DIAGNOSIS: ${diagnosis}
CONFIDENCE LEVEL: ${Math.round(confidence * 100)}%

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
- Pulmonary fields with preserved transparency
- Absence of consolidations or infiltrates
- Normal cardiomediastinal silhouette
- Well-defined diaphragms
- No signs of pleural effusion observed

INTERPRETATION:
Chest X-ray presents characteristics within normal parameters according to 
artificial intelligence analysis. No radiological signs compatible with pneumonia identified.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Reassuring result from radiological standpoint
2. Correlate with patient clinical symptoms
3. If respiratory symptoms persist, consider other causes
4. Maintain routine clinical follow-up
5. Repeat studies only if clinical picture changes

IMPORTANT NOTE:
A normal result does not completely exclude pulmonary pathology, 
especially in very early stages of infection. Clinical correlation 
is always fundamental.

FOLLOW-UP:
- Medical control according to symptoms
- New evaluation if alarm signs appear
- Maintain general preventive measures
